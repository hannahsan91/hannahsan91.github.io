I don't know that many people would refute the gender disparity in the tech world, or STEM careers as a whole. I believe this is down to sexism--maybe not always conscious--in schools and families during childhood development. 

I know for myself, both a lack of exposure to STEM activities and courses and an *active discouragement* of involvement shaped a lot of missed opportunities for me. 

It's important to expose little girls to STEM and broader educational options. The important thing here is not always being pretty!
