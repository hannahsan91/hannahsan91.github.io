I don’t know that many people would refute the gender disparity in the tech world, or STEM careers as a whole. I believe this is down to sexism–maybe not always conscious–in schools and families during childhood development.

In my own life, I know that this discouragement preventing me from making choices that I knew I wanted to: and, for whatever reason, I let those societal pressures guide me into an unsatisfying BA degree in a major I cared nothing about, instead of going after the Computer Science degree I wanted.

I think introducing girls to and encouraging them in STEM is necessary: that's lots of minds and potential wasted!
