Growing up, I have always loved languages. I minored in French, fell in love with Latin and Romanian, and even attempted learning Klingon to no avail. Once I got into middle school, I discovered the Internet. More specifically, I discovered MySpace, and all the fun little personalizations you could do to it. I then wandered over to my Mac's terminal. I immediately wanted to know everything I could about the new language I'd discovered!

At the time, unfortunately, there weren't the opportunities available to me that there are now; I didn't even know software engineers existed, and anything to do with STEM was *not* encouraged for females, both in my family and in my school. Had I known, I like to think I would have picked Computer Science as my major, but as it stood, I went down a BA path instead.

Fun fact: I tried to convince my parents to let me drop out of college and attend a tradeschool instead; I was in love with cars, and wanted to be a mechanic. Today, I just work on my own Jeep :)

Fast forward some years later: I had been agonizing over whether I should go back to school for a new 4-year degree (expensive), or attempting to get accepted into a masters program for CS (not likely with my background as a BA).  I can't even remember now how, but I stumbled across Career Karma, and subsequently Flatiron. This bootcamp is basically the answer to *everything* I never knew was possible for me!
