Why Representation matters
I don’t know that many people would refute the gender disparity in the tech world, or STEM careers as a whole. I believe this is down to sexism–maybe not always conscious–in schools and families during childhood development.
In my own life, I know that this discouragement prevented me from making choices that I knew I wanted to: and, for whatever reason, I let those societal pressures guide me into an unsatisfying BA degree in a major I cared nothing about (which took me two extra years to complete), instead of going after the Computer Science degree I’d originally wanted.
Introducing girls to and encouraging them in STEM is necessary: that’s lots of minds and potential wasted
