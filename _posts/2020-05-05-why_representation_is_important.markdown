It seems to me, from the Learn curriculum, that Software Engineering must be 100% coding, day in and day out,  whether that be indiviudal coding, or through pair programming. On further independent research, I've gleaned that this is not necessarily the case: yes, lots of coding is involved, but it's certainly not *all* that's involved. I thought, more or less, one would be spending the day in front of a computer, deep in code-mode. 

In actuality, it appears that there is *a lot* of teamwork that goes into Software Engineering. If building apps, for example, you will be working with anyone from other coders, to project managers, to a marketing team, so verbal and written communication skills are important. Certainly makes me feel like I have something to add, as a BA in Communications :)
